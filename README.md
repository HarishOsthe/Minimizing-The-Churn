# Minimizing-The-Churn
Subscriptiton products often are the main source of revenue for companies across all industries. These products can come in the form of a "one size fits" overcompassing subscription, or in multi-level memberships. Regardless of how they structure their memberships, or what industry they are in, comapnies almost try to minimize customer churn (a.k.a. subscription cancellations). To retain their customers, these companies first need to identify behavioral patterns that act as catalyst in disengagement with the product.
